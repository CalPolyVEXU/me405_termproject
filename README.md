# Proposed System Description

The goal of our project is to be able to create a system that makes drawings similar to a plotter. Our proposed system will accomplish the goal of creating a drawing and also allows for curved motion directly through the motion of the arm. Our system consists of a robot arm-type system inspired by the Line-us drawing robot. We will use the two Pittman DC geared motors found in the ME405 tubs to control a set of four linkages. The two motors will me mounted inline vertically, facing each other, and connect at the center location to two of the linkages. A Tower Pro MG995 servo motor borrowed from the robotics lab will be used to control an up and down movement to raise and lower the pen from the drawing surface. We will have a 2.5 degree of freedom system with two degrees of freedom from the two DC geared motors and a half degree of freedom from the servo motor to raise and lower the system. The four linkages form a semi-diamond shape that creates a robot arm that functions similarly to a SCARA-type robot arm. We plan on laser-cutting the linkages from scrap pieces of acrylic that are approximately 0.25" thick. The motors will be mounted using a 3D-printed casing. Additional components required for the up and down movement of the system will also be 3D-printed.
